DEVICE_MICROPHONE_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_SETTING_HEADER_VOICE_EQUALIZER: VOICE EQ
DEVICE_MICROPHONE_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_SETTING_TOOLTIP_DE_POPPER: High-Pass Filter lets the high frequency information pass through the filter at a target frequency and rolls off all audio below the target frequency. This can be helpful to remove low frequency noise like car engines or heavy equipment and even fans in the room.
DEVICE_MICROPHONE_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_SETTING_TOOLTIP_DE_ESSER: De-esser listens to the high frequencies for hissing or sibilant sounds that are generally unpleasant. The tool listens at the target frequency (8KHz by default) and compresses that frequency when the threshold is reached by the amount set by the ratio control.
DEVICE_MICROPHONE_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_SETTING_TOOLTIP_NOISE_REDUCTION: Noise reduction removes unwanted noise from an audio signal. It is best at removing consistently produced noises like fans, road noise, rain and other non-anomalous and consistent unwanted sounds.
DEVICE_MICROPHONE_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_SETTING_TOOLTIP_COMPRESSOR: Compressor reduces the dynamic range of an audio signal by attenuating the output in relation to the threshold and ratio controls. This essentially makes your voice signal more consistent in volume and therefore easier to hear whether you are screaming or whispering.
DEVICE_MICROPHONE_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_SETTING_TOOLTIP_EXPANDER: Expander is a noise gate with a variable range. This can be very useful to remove unwanted background noise like dog barking, children playing, television, etc when not speaking into the mic. If you set the threshold slightly below the level of your voice, the gate will open only when you're speaking and cut out any other noise when you’re not.
DEVICE_MICROPHONE_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_SETTING_TOOLTIP_LIMITER: Limiter compresses the output of the audio signal in an infinite ratio essentially “limiting” the signal to never be able to get louder than the desired level.
